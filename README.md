Homework 3 of the Data Bootcamp

Two Python programs that loop through CSV files to calculate and output calculations based on the data therein. 

NOTE: I made most of my commits directly through github (I didn't fully understand how to commit from the terminal yet), but all subsequent commits have been/will be made through git locally.

TODO: come back to shorten code and make more efficient/elegant as class/python familiarity progresses.
